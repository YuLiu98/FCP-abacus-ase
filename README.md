# FCP-vasp-ase
ASE interface for fully converged constant potential (FCP) simulations with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)

version 2.0


The constant-potential calculator was developed by Zhaoming Xia.

**If you use this code, please cite:** ***https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00237 *** 
The original paper used the code of version 1.0


## Before you use

1. If you want to run constant-potential calculation properly, the vaspsol code (https://github.com/henniggroup/VASPsol) should be included in the source code directory of VASP before compiling VASP; the patch of vaspsol should be applied to compute the FERMI_SHIFT (installation guidance: https://github.com/henniggroup/VASPsol/blob/master/README.md); add -Dsol_compat option to the list of precompiler options(CPP_OPTIONS) in the makefile of VASP, then compile VASP.

2. Make sure you have installed python and pip.

3. Install ase by 'pip install ase'.

2. Copy FCPelectrochem.py to "ase_installation_path/calculators/".(note:ase_installation_path can be found by running 'ase info')

3. If you want to use PLUMED interface, the python wrap of PLUMED should be installed. Read this page for more information (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/plumed.html).

## How to use (version 2)

1. The path of the directory containing the pseudopotential directories (potpaw,potpaw_GGA, potpaw_PBE, ...) should be set by the environmental flag $VASP_PP_PATH.

2. A simple example to call the module:

          )

## Other DFT-calculators
This interface only support Vasp calculator. If you want to use other calculator, you should define the read_fermishift() function get_fermi_level()

## For advanced users

The grand energy Egrand is defined as:

Egrand = E + E_Fermi_shift * (Nelect - Nelect0) + (U + work_SHE) * (Nelect - Nelect0)

Note that the averaged electrostatic potential of the periodic cell is zero for DFT, which indicates that the electronic energy is referenced at the averaged electrostatic potential. It has no influence for the system with no net charge (Nelect - Nelect0 = 0). However, the electronic energy should be referenced at vacuum if the net charge in nonzero, since the work function of SHE is referenced at vacuum. Thus, "E_Fermi_shift * (Nelect - Nelect0)" should not be ignored.

If you want to use this code for other DFT-calculators, you must define a function to calculate the E_Fermi_shift. A reasonable approximation for E_Fermi_shift is to calculate the electrostatic potential at the point where there is the lowest electron density.

The way to verify the E_Fermi_shift is to plot the Egrand and |Ucal-U|. If E_Fermi_shift is reasonable, the minimum point for Egrand and |Ucal-U| should be the same.

The accuracy of electronic step is critical for the convergence of FCP. I recommend to use a high an accuracy for DFT calculations unless the electronic step is extremely slow.

For molecular dynamics, one should turn off "always_adjust" and set max_FCP_iter into 1 to disable the converging of electrochemical potential and allow the fluctuation of electrochemical potential.
